# Urbit By Doing

A dysfunctional programmer's guide to making things in Hoon.

## About

Urbit By Doing is a series of tutorials that focus on writing Hoon applications from scratch. They are targeted at developers with only a very basic understanding of Hoon. If you have worked through the [Quickstart](urbit.org/docs/arvo/) and/or [Hoon](urbit.org/docs/hoon/) docs, you should be able to follow along. If not, the tutorials aren't well-written enough.

I personally can't guarantee you won't read false information here, but I try to get more qualified eyes on these texts as soon after their initial release as possible. When in doubt, check the official documentation or consult the great minds in the `~dozbud/urbit-meta` talk station.
